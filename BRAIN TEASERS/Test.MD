# Quick Test Challenge – Hub 2 & Hub 3  

Welcome to the **1 Hour Quick Test**!  
We’re looking for winners from **both Hubs** 🎯.  

---

## 🕒 Test Details
- **Start Time:** 8:30PM  
- **End Time:** 9:30PM  
- **Duration:** 1 Hour  

---

## 📝 Instructions
- Write clean and readable code.  
- Follow **best practices** (naming, comments, DRY, KISS).  
- Attempt all questions.  
- Push your final solutions in a GitHub repo called **`quick-test-hub`**.  

---

## 🔹 Section 1: Variables, Data Types & Operators (10 marks)

1. Declare a variable that stores your **Hub number** (e.g., `hub = 2` or `hub = 3`). Print:  
```

I belong to Hub X

````

2. Write a Python/JavaScript statement that calculates the **area of a rectangle** with `length = 8` and `width = 5`.  

3. Given:  
```python
x = 15
y = 4
````

* Find:

  * Quotient
  * Remainder
  * Power (`x` raised to `y`)

---

## 🔹 Section 2: Control Flow (15 marks)

4. Write a program that prints whether a number is **positive, negative, or zero**.

5. Using a **for loop**, print numbers from `1 to 10`, but skip the number `5`.

6. Write a **switch-case / match-case** (Python ≥3.10 or JavaScript) that takes a day number (1–7) and prints the corresponding day name.

---

## 🔹 Section 3: Functions & Scope (15 marks)

7. Define a function `greet(name)` that prints:

   ```
   Hello, <name>! Welcome to Hub X.
   ```

8. Write a function `sum_even_numbers(n)` that takes a number `n` and returns the sum of all even numbers from `1` to `n`.

9. Explain with code: What happens if a variable is declared **inside a function** vs **outside** (scope)?

---

## 🔹 Section 4: Best Practices (10 marks)

10. Rewrite the following bad code snippet using **best practices** (naming, DRY, comments):

```python
a=10
b=20
print(a+b)
print(a*b)
print(a-b)
```

✅ Expected:

* Meaningful variable names
* A function to handle operations
* Comments

---

## 🔹 Mini-Challenge (Bonus – 10 marks)

**FizzBuzz Problem:**
Write a program that prints numbers from `1 to 30`. But for multiples of `3`, print `"Fizz"`, for multiples of `5`, print `"Buzz"`, and for multiples of both `3` and `5`, print `"FizzBuzz"`.

Would you like me to also create a **GitHub repo starter package** (README + empty `hub2/` and `hub3/` folders with placeholder `answers.py`) so participants can just fork/clone and start coding instantly?
